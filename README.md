- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass: CSS pre-processer


### What I learned

#### Flexbox

Put horizontally arranged items in a flex container. The direct child `<div>`s are items:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```
